Passionate and enthusiastic about problem-solving through technology.

My coding journey began in 2019, and I also used GitLab during my eperience at Merkle (2021-2023) and Bitbucket while at Corporating (2019-2020).

My primary focus has been on front-end development. I worked extensively with Angular in 2019 / 20, followed by working with Vanilla JS/TS and React throughout 2021 / 22 / 23. Additionally, I have enhanced my skills in React, Redux, and Jest from 2023 onwards
