Passionate and enthusiastic about problem-solving through technology.

I'm currently using this account for my job, but in all my previous jobs, I used another account. That's why you can't see much interaction here. I've also tried GitLab and Bitbucket.

My coding journey kicked off in 2019. Spent a good year working with Angular, then I jumped into different projects with React and its crew (Redux, ContextAPI, Next.js) alongside TypeScript, Jest, REST, GraphQL, Less, Sass, Tailwind, and other cool stuff along the way.

I spend a lot more time learning through reading and writing, watching videos, blogs, and creating simple POVS on VSCode to understand new concepts than creating side projects here on GH.
